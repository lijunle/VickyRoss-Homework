      <h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Koa is a new web framework designed by the team behind
				Express, which aims to be a smaller, more expressive, and more
				robust foundation for web applications and APIs. Through leveraging
				generators Koa allows you to ditch callbacks and greatly increase
				error-handling. Koa does not bundle any middleware within core, and
				provides an elegant suite of methods that make writing servers fast
				and enjoyable.</p>

			<h1>Installation</h1>
			<p>
				Koa works out of the box with recent versions of Node. To use Koa
				with 0.11.x you must use the <code>--harmony</code> or <code>--harmony-generators</code>
				flag.
			</p>
			<pre>
$ npm install koa
$ node app.js</pre>

		<div id="application" class="content-spacing inner-box">
			<h1>Application</h1>
			<p>A Koa application is an object containing an array of
				middleware generator functions which are composed and executed in a
				stack-like manner upon request. Koa is similar to many other
				middleware systems that you may have encountered such as Ruby's
				Rack, Connect, and so on - however a key design decision was made to
				provide high level "sugar" at the otherwise low-level middleware
				layer. This improves interoperability, robustness, and makes writing
				middleware much more enjoyable. This includes methods for common
				tasks like content-negotiation, cache freshness, proxy support, and
				redirection among others. Despite supplying a reasonably large
				number of helpful methods Koa maintains a small footprint, as no
				middleware are bundled. The obligatory hello world application:</p>
			<pre>
var koa = require('koa');
var app = koa();
			
app.use(function *(){
this.body = 'Hello World';
});
			
app.listen(3000);	</pre>

			
			<div id="cascading" class="content-spacing">
				<h2>Cascading</h2>
				<p>
					Koa middleware cascade in a more traditional way as you may be used
					to with similar tools - this was previously difficult to make user
					friendly with node's use of callbacks. However with generators we
					can achieve "true" middleware. Contrasting Connect's implementation
					which simply passes control through series of functions until one
					returns, Koa yields "downstream", then control flows back
          "upstream".</p>
          <p>The following example responds with
					"Hello World", however first the request flows through the <code>x-response-time</code>
					and <code>logging</code> middleware to mark when the request
					started, then continue to yield control through the response
					middleware. When a middleware invokes <code>yield next</code> the
					function suspends and passes control to the next middleware
					defined. After there are no more middleware to execute downstream,
					the stack will unwind and each middleware is resumed to perform its
					upstream behaviour.
          </p>
				
				<pre>
var koa = require('koa');
var app = koa(); 

// x-response-time 

app.use(function *(next){ 
  var start = new Date; 
  yield next; var ms = new Date - start; 
  this.set('X-Response-Time', ms + 'ms'); 
}); 

// logger 

app.use(function *(next){ 
  var start = new Date; 
  yield next; 
  var ms = new Date - start; 
  console.log('%s %s - %s', this.method, this.url, ms); 
}); 

// response 

app.use(function *(){ 
  this.body = 'Hello World'; 
}); 

app.listen(3000);	</pre>

			<div id="settings" class="content-spacing">
				<h2>Settings</h2>
				<p>Application settings are properties on the app instance,
					currently the following are supported:</p>
				<ul>
          <li><code>app.name</code> optionally give your application a name</li>
          <li><code>app.env</code> defaulting to the <strong>NODE_ENV</strong> or "development"</li>
          <li><code>app.proxywhen</code> true proxy header fields will be trusted</li>              <li><code>app.subdomainOffset</code>    offset of .subdomains to ignore [2]</li>
				</ul>

			<div id="app.listen" class="content-spacing">
				<h2>app.listen(...)</h2>
				<p>
					A Koa application is not a 1-to-1 representation of a HTTP server.
					One or more Koa applications may be mounted together to form larger
          applications with a single HTTP server.</p>
    <p>Create and
					return an HTTP server, passing the given arguments to <code>Server#listen()</code>.
					These arguments are documented on <a href="#">nodejs.org</a>. The
					following is a useless Koa application bound to port <code>3000</code>:
				</p>
				
				<pre>
var koa = require('koa');
var app = koa();
app.listen(3000);</pre>
				
				<p>
					The <code>app.listen(...)</code> method is simply sugar for the
					following:
				</p>
				
				<pre>
var http = require('http');
var koa = require('koa');
var app = koa();
http.createServer(app.callback()).listen(3000);</pre>
				
				<p>When an error occurs and it is still possible to respond to
					the client, aka no data has been written to the socket, Koa will
					respond appropriately with a 500 "Internal Server Error". In either
					case an app-level "error" is emitted for logging purposes.</p>

			<h1>Context</h1>
			<p>
				A Koa Context encapsulates node's <code>request</code> and <code>response</code>
				objects into a single object which provides many helpful methods for
				writing web applications and APIs. These operations are used so
				frequently in HTTP server development that they are added at this
				level instead of a higher level framework, which would force
				middleware to re-implement this common functionality. <br /> A <code>Context</code>
				is created per request, and is referenced in middleware as the
				receiver, or the <code>this</code> identifier, as shown in the
				following snippet:
			</p>
			<h3>response.vary(field)</h3>
			<p>
				Vary on <code>field.</code>
